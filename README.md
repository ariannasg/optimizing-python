## Description
Understanding how to optimise Python by following the course https://www.linkedin.com/learning/faster-python-code/.

## Objectives
- Rules of optimization
- Measuring time
- Using line_profiler
- Picking the right data structure
- Using the bisect module
- Memory allocation in Python
- Caching, cheating, and parallel computing
- NumPy, Numba, and Cython
- Design and code reviews

## Local setup
- Install python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
- Install project dependencies using requirements.txt
        - Create and activate a virtual environment, then install deps:
            ```
            python3 -m venv ~/.python-envs/<name>
            source  ~/.python-envs/<name>/bin/activate
            (<name>) âžœ  make install
            ```
- Configure the IDE Interpreter to use the virtual environment as project interpreter.
- Setup the run configuration in the IDE if needed: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html?keymap=secondary_macos.

## Security
Command for running security checks on installed dependencies for security vulnerabilities:
