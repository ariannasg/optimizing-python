# Units of measurement that can be shown by timeit:
# We have milliseconds, which are abbreviated with ms and we have 1,000 of
# these in one second.
#
# After that we have microseconds which are abbreviated with mu (μ), the Greek
# letter μS, and there are 1,000,000 of these in a second.
#
# And then we have nanoseconds, abbreviated with ns,
# and there are 1,000,000,000 of these in a second.


# 1sec -> 1 thousand ms (milliseconds)
# 1sec -> 1 million μS (microseconds)
# 1sec -> 1 billion ns (nanoseconds)
